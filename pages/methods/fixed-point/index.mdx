# Fixed-Point Iteration

Fixed Point Iteration is a widely-used numerical method for solving equations of the form $f(x) = 0$. It aims to find a fixed point, $x$, of a given function $g(x)$ such that $x = g(x)$. If the function $f(x)$ can be rearranged into the form $x = g(x)$, then Fixed Point Iteration can be used to find an approximation to the root of the equation $f(x) = 0$ by iteratively applying the function $g(x)$ to an initial estimate of the fixed point.

The method is based on the idea that if the function $g(x)$ converges to a fixed point $x$ as the number of iterations increases, then the root of the equation $f(x) = 0$ can be approximated by the fixed point $x$. This convergence property is determined by the behavior of the function $g(x)$ and the choice of the initial estimate.

## Fixed-Point Iteration Algorithm

The Fixed Point Iteration algorithm revolves around the iterative application of a chosen function, $g(x)$, derived from the original function $f(x)$. The method starts with an initial estimate, $x_0$, for the fixed point and generates a sequence of approximations to the fixed point $x$ by evaluating the function $g(x)$ at each approximation.

At each iteration, the algorithm computes the next approximation $x_{n+1}$ by applying the function $g(x)$ to the current approximation $x_n$. This process continues until the difference between consecutive approximations becomes smaller than a predefined tolerance, $TOL$, or a maximum number of iterations, $n_{max}$, is reached.

The sequence of approximations can be expressed mathematically as:

1. Choose an initial approximation, $x_0$.
2. Compute $x_{n+1} = g(x_n)$ for $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$

### Python Implementation

```py
def fixed_point_iteration(g: Callable[[float], float], x0: float, tol: float, max_iter: int = 30) -> Tuple[float, List[float]]:
    """
    Finds the fixed point of a continuous function g using FPI.

    :param g: The continuous function for which to find the fixed point.
    :param x0: The initial estimate for the fixed point.
    :param tol: The tolerance for stopping the iterations.
    :param max_iter: The maximum number of iterations (default: 30).
    :return: A tuple containing the fixed point and a list of approximations.
    """

    # Initialize variables
    x = x0
    n = 0
    history = []

    # Iterate until tolerance is met or maximum iterations are reached
    while n < max_iter:
        x_next = g(x)
        history.append(x_next)

        if abs(x_next - x) < tol:
            break

        x = x_next
        n += 1

    return x_next, history
```

## Convergence of Fixed-Point Iteration

The convergence of Fixed-Point Iteration is not always guaranteed. However, under certain conditions, the method converges to the fixed point. One of the sufficient conditions for convergence is when the function $g$ is a contraction mapping on the interval $[a, b]$ containing the fixed point, which means there exists a constant <br/> $0 < L < 1$ such that for all $x, y$ in the interval, $|g(x) - g(y)| \le L|x - y|$.

When the convergence conditions are met, Fixed-Point Iteration converges linearly, which means that the number of correct digits in the approximation increases with each iteration. The rate of convergence is determined by the Lipschitz constant $L$, with a smaller $L$ leading to faster convergence.

It is important to note that the convergence of Fixed-Point Iteration is sensitive to the choice of the initial estimate $x_0$ and the function $g$. A poor choice of $x_0$ or $g$ may result in slow convergence or divergence.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Fixed-Point Iteration

### Advantages

1. Simplicity: The Fixed-Point Iteration algorithm is straightforward and easy to implement.
2. No need for derivatives: The method does not require the calculation of derivatives, making it suitable for functions whose derivatives are difficult to compute or don't exist.
3. Customizable: The choice of the function $g(x)$ can be adjusted to improve the rate of convergence or to ensure convergence in certain cases.

### Disadvantages

1. Convergence not always guaranteed: Fixed-Point Iteration is not guaranteed to converge to a root for every function or initial estimate. The method's convergence depends on the choice of the function $g(x)$ and the initial estimate $x_0$.
2. Sensitive to initial estimate: The convergence of Fixed-Point Iteration is sensitive to the choice of the initial estimate $x_0$. A poor choice of $x_0$ may result in slow convergence or divergence.
3. Linear convergence: Fixed-Point Iteration converges linearly, which is slower than some other root-finding methods like Newton's method or the Secant method that offer a faster rate of convergence.

## Real-life Applications

The Fixed-Point Iteration method is widely used in various fields such as engineering, physics, and finance for solving equations and optimization problems. Some common applications include:

1. Engineering: Fixed-Point Iteration is essential for solving equations in control systems, electrical circuits, and chemical kinetics.
2. Physics: The method can be applied to problems in thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and astrophysics.
3. Finance: Fixed-Point Iteration is used to solve equilibrium problems in economics and for finding solutions in game theory.

In conclusion, Fixed-Point Iteration is a versatile and easy-to-implement technique for finding the roots of a function. While its convergence is not guaranteed for every function or initial estimate, its adaptability and wide applicability make it a valuable tool in many fields.
