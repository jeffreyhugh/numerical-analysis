# The Bisection Method

The Bisection method is a popular and straightforward numerical technique for finding the roots of
a continuous function within a given interval.
Based on the Intermediate Value Theorem, this iterative method guarantees convergence to a root
under specific conditions, making it a reliable and robust choice for root-finding problems.

### Intermediate Value Theorem

The Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) is a fundamental theorem in calculus that states that if a continuous function f(x) is defined on a closed interval [a, b], and k is any value between f(a) and f(b), then there exists at least one point c within the interval [a, b] such that f(c) = k.

#### Mathematically, IVT can be defined as follows:

Let $f$ be a continuous function on the interval $[a, b]$. Then $f$ realizes every value between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$.
More precisely, if $y$ is a number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there exists a number $c$ with $a ≤ c ≤ b$ such that
$f(c) = y$.

## Bisection Algorithm

The Bisection algorithm involves repeatedly dividing an interval containing a root into two equal subintervals
and selecting the subinterval where the function changes sign as the new interval.

This process continues until the width of the interval becomes smaller than a predefined tolerance $'TOL'$ or a maximum number of iterations $'n'$ is reached.

### Python Implementation

```py
def bisection(f: Callable[[float], float], a: float, b: float, tol: float, max_iter: int = 30) -> Tuple[float, List[Tuple[float, float, float]]]:
    """
    Finds the root of a continuous function f in the interval [a, b].

    :param f: The continuous function for which to find the root.
    :param a: The lower bound of the interval.
    :param b: The upper bound of the interval.
    :param tol: The tolerance for stopping the iterations.
    :param max_iter: The maximum number of iterations (default: 30).
    :return: A tuple containing the root and a list of intermediate values (a, b, c).
    """

    # Ensure that f(a) * f(b) < 0 (i.e., there's a root in the interval)
    if f(a) * f(b) >= 0:
        raise ValueError("f(a) and f(b) should have opposite signs")

    # Initialize variables
    c = (a + b) / 2
    n = 0
    history = []

    # Iterate until tolerance is met or maximum iterations are reached
    while (b - a) / 2 > tol and n < max_iter:
        c = (a + b) / 2
        history.append((a, b, c))

        if f(c) == 0:
            break
        elif f(a) * f(c) < 0:
            b = c
        else:
            a = c
        n += 1

    return c, history
```

While the Bisection method may not be the fastest root-finding technique, its simplicity, ease of
implementation, and guaranteed convergence make it a widely used and essential tool in
various fields such as engineering, physics, and finance.

## Convergence of the Bisection Method

The Bisection method is guaranteed to converge to a root under specific conditions. The method converges if the function $f$ is continuous on the interval $[a, b]$ and <br />
$f(a) * f(b) < 0$, which ensures that there is a root in the given interval according to the Intermediate Value Theorem.

The Bisection method has a linear rate of convergence, which means that the number of correct digits in the approximation doubles with each iteration.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of the Bisection Method

### Advantages

1. Guaranteed convergence: The Bisection method is guaranteed to converge to a root under the given conditions, making it a reliable choice for root-finding problems.
2. Simplicity: The algorithm is easy to understand and implement.
3. Robustness: The method is relatively unaffected by the presence of noise in the function or its derivatives, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

### Disadvantages

1. Slow convergence: The Bisection method converges linearly, which is slower than some other root-finding methods like Newton's method or the Secant method that offer a faster rate of convergence.
2. Requires a bracketing interval: The method needs an interval containing the root with opposite function values at the interval's endpoints, which may not always be easy to find.

## Real-life Applications

The Bisection method is widely used in various fields such as engineering, physics, and finance for solving equations and optimization problems. Some common applications include:

1. Engineering: Root-finding is essential for solving equations in fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and structural analysis.
2. Physics: The Bisection method can be applied to problems in mechanics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.
3. Finance: The method is used to find implied volatilities in options pricing models and to solve equations in financial mathematics.

In conclusion, the Bisection method is a simple, reliable, and robust technique for finding the roots of a continuous function within a given interval. While it may not be the fastest method available, its guaranteed convergence and wide applicability make it a valuable tool in many fields.
